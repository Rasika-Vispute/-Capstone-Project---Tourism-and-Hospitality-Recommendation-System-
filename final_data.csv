The temple was built in 1060 AD[1] beautifully carved in stone. It was probably built by Shilahara king Chhittaraja, it may also have been rebuilt by his son Mummuni.[2]
Unusually, the sanctuary or garbhagriha is below ground, reached by some 20 steps down from the mandapa, and is open to the sky as the shikhara tower above stops abruptly at a little above the height of the mandapa, and was apparently never completed. It is in bhumija form, and if completed would have been close in form to the Udayesvara Temple also known as Neelkantheshwara temple in Udaipur, Madhya Pradesh, begun in 1059,[3] and the Gondeshwar Temple at Sinnar.[4] It is clear from what was built that the shikhara would have followed these in having four corner bands of gavaksha-honeycomb sweeping uninterrupted up the full height of the tower, while in between each face has rows of five spirelets on individual podia, reducing in size up the tower.[5]

There's also a possibility that the shikhar here represents of Sky as the name suggests Ambarnath which means the Sky. ???? in sanskrit is sky. So the shikhar here is sky and thus the tower might have not stopped abruptly"

Anand district, the name that has been inscribed in golden letters in the history of modern India because of White revolution and the largest co-operative sector development, was basically part of the Kheda district. ItÂs only in 1997 when Anand got its existence. So the history of the Anand district is not so old but yes as a part of ÂCharotarÂ (Another name of the Kheda district in vogue) it has very vast and rich legacy. Anand is also called ÂCharotarÂ as itÂs the home of goodly land, a tract of the most fertile and well tilled soil. Even the dialect spoken by the people inhabiting here is called ÂCharotariÂ. The word ÂCharotarÂ is derived from the Sanskrit word ÂCharuÂ meaning beautiful. The land is fertile and Green with vegetation and so it pleases the eye and is called Charotar tract. Though the entire area is prosperous and productive, some parts of the Khambhat Taluka and Tarapur Taluka called ÂBhaalÂ region is having problems of agricultural productivity because of the saline land and sea coast effect. But the wheat of ÂBhaalÂ region is very famous because of its superior quality.Anand is a major city located in the Anand District of Gujarat. It rests at a distance of 101 kilometres from Gandhinagar, the state capital. Anand is often known as the Milk Capital of India due to the establishment of the AMUL manufacturing plant and the milk revolution that took place in the 20th century. 

The epicentre of the white revolution in the country back in the 60s, Anand is a place known for its semi-rural setup and the Swami Narayan Mandir which is the crown jewel of the city. An emerging city, Anand still has traces of its rural past which can be seen when one is travelling to this wonderful city.

Their local cuisine is Gujrati and comprises of Dhokla, Khakda, Fafda and more. Anand is also a major tourist hub and its attractions include AMUL Museum and the Chocolate Factory.

51,UTTAR PRADESH,Ballia ,"There are two stories behind the origin of the name Ballia. Firstly, it is believed that the name of the city Ballia is derived from the name of one of the famous saints of Indian history, Valmiki. Locals have a belief that Valmiki, the author of Ramayana resided in this city and, hence, there was a shrine built at that place. However, the shrine no longer exists.

According to the second story, the city is named as Ballia due to quality of the soil of the land. Ballia has a sandy soil and this type of soil is known as ÂBalluaÂ. It is believed that this city was initially called as ÂBalianÂ and then was transformed as ÂBalliaÂ. Ballia experiences very hot climate during the summer months from March to June. The temperature goes as high as 45 degrees in the day time. However, the winters here are cool and pleasant. The temperature falls till 17 degrees during a pleasant day. Hence, if you plan a trip to Ballia, you should plan in the winter months of October to February. Ballia is one of the tourist places in Uttar Pradesh. This city has a religious importance. Also, there are various places or cities you can visit from Ballia. Once you are in Ballia, you can visit many places like Ghazipur, Bela Pratapgarh, Allahabad, and Varanasi."

Adivasis, or primitive people use to inhabit the region in prehistoric times. The earliest known Aryan people associated with this region were the ceedis mentioned in Rigveda. The region is believed to have a rich historical background.

Bamdeo, the great sage from whom this district derives its name Bamda (later Banda) lived in this region. It is also believed that Lord Rama has spent 12 of the 14 years of his exile at Chitrakoot, which was part of Banda until few years ago. The famous Kalinjar-hill (Kalanjaradri) is said to have derived its name from Lord Shiva himself who is the main deity of Kalinjar called Nilakantha even today.

The city, founded in 1537, was built largely by the Mughal governor Makrand Ray. It later became the capital of the Rohillas, a migrant Afghan clan that gained control of the surrounding territory. In 1774, during the Rohilla War, the ruler of Oudh (Ayodhya) conquered the area with British aid, and Bareilly was ceded to the British in 1801.

63,ORISSA,Baripada Town ,"Originally the capital of the Mayurbhanj State, Baripada's antiquity is unknown. It was first recorded as Burpuddah by Major James Rennell of the East India Company in his famous Atlas of 1779. The origins of the name are doubtful but it appears to be derived from the Bauri tribe that originally inhabited this area.[citation needed]

The ruins of an old mud fort in the centre of the town have completely disappeared. A temple dedicated to Ambika Devi is the sole survivor. The chief shrine of the town is a Jagannath temple dating from 1575 AD. It is also the oldest structure in the area. A statue of the Buddhist deity Lokeshvara housed in one of its rooms is even older. However, Baripada developed into a town only under the rule of Maharaja Jadunatha Bhanja who died in 1863. His successors, especially Maharaja Sriram Chandra Bhanj Deo, added many other public buildings to the town. Baripada was linked to Rupsa in Balasore district through a narrow gauge line known as the Mayurbhanj State Railway in the first decade of the 20th century. This provided a major impetus to trade and commerce.

The town continued to grow after the merger of Mayurbhanj State with the Union of India in 1949. In contrast to the planned nature of the town centre, the newer areas have tended to adopt a sprawling nature.  Baripada is popular for its art and culture. Many famous stars of Ollywood (Oriya film industry) are from Baripada. Baripada is famous for the Chhau dance form, famous all over the world. The Chaitra Parva celebrated in mid-April recognizes the local talents."
64,PUNJAB,Barnala ,"Before getting into the current position, earlier and a long time ago Barnala was the capital of Patiala Riyasat, when Patiala became Riyasat at that time Barnala was declared as district headquarters and Bathinda and Mansa were two tehsils of Patiala Riyasat. During the time when India got freedom, Bathinda was declared a separate district and during the year 1954 Riyasat Rule was abolished and was transformed into Pepsu Rule. Rampura and Malerkotla were its two tehsils. Barnala lost its pride to a larger extent when Patiala Riyasat Rule was abolished and was mingled into Punjab.

At that time Barnala was a sub-division only, but before that when Barnala was District Headquarters, being headquarter it was having District Session JudgeÂs Court, but later on When it became a sub-division only, then Additional District and Session Judge powers were provided to Barnala. It seems that Dera Baba Gandha Singh is also closely associated with history of District Barnala. Once upon a time Bibi Pardhan Kaur Ji who was also famous with the name of Pardhan Kaur (Daughter of Maharaja Ala Singh Ji) went to Muktsar. She met with Baba Lammar Singh and was deeply impressed by his holy recite. Then She Requested Baba Lammar Singh to send the saint just like him so that he could start the same sangat and langar practice at Barnala too.

Accepting her request Baba Lammar Singh allocated one of his pupils Pandit Nika Singh to perform the task. Maharaja Ala Singh had also heard a lot about Baba Lammar Singh and Pandit Nika Singh and also when Maharaj queried about the teacher for his daughter the name which was suggested was Pandit Nika Singh. Following Baba Lammar SinghÂs order Pandit Nika Singh arrived at Barnala and here Maharaja Ala Singh gifted a very beautiful house to Pandit Nika Singh and he started doing Sangat at this place and thus Dera Baba Gandha Singh Ji came into existence and the Langar was started on regular basis in the Fort. Even now a days also one can find the Baba Ala SinghÂs Oven in the Fort. This Gurudwara is famous with name of Baba Chula Sahib. Geeta Bhawan in Barnala

There is a lot of controversy and debate regarding the naming of ""Basirhat"". But all explanations are satisfying and are causally related in some or other way. It implies that if we examine the sources then it will reflect the one or other socio-economic dimensions of the ""Basirhat"" region.

The sources which are considered till now behind the naming of Basirhat are as follows:

Bahurhat - market for various items.

Banserhat - market for buying and selling bamboos.

Bastirhat - low land market

According to Dr. Sukumar Sen, Basirhat is named after a person named 'Basi'. Referring to Bengali Dictionary, the word Basi means-Indriya Basban, Jitendriya, Apradhin, Sadhin, Swatantra. From this it may be concluded that Basirhat was an independent tax-free business centre. Like present day's Free Business Centres. Popular places to visit

67,UTTAR PRADESH,Basti ,"Basti was originally known as Vaishishthi.[3] The origin of the name Vaishishthi is attributed to the fact that this area was the ashram of Rishi (sage) Vashistha in ancient period. Rama with his younger brother Lakshmana had been here for some time with Rishi Vashistha.

The tract comprising the present district was remote and much of it was covered with forest. But gradually the area became inhabitable, for want of recorded and reliable history it cannot, with any degree of certainty, be said how the district came to be known by its present name on account of the original habitation (Basti) having been selected by the Kalhans Raja Udai Raj Singh as a seat of his Raj, an event which probably occurred in the 16th century. In 1801, Basti became the Tehsil headquarters and in 1865 it was chosen as the headquarters of the newly established district.The region was under the rule of Kalhans dynasty based at modern Chaukhara.[4] Maharaja Kesri Singh was the last ruler of Kalhans dynasty based at Chaukhara.[5]

According to Ibn Batuta it was known as Batrind. The earliest mention of Tabarhindh occurs in the ÂJami-Ul-HakayatÂ written about 607 Hijri or 1211 AD.

70,RAJASTHAN,Beawar ,"Beawar was founded by Colonel Charles George Dixon (1795-1857) in 1836. Beawar was part of British India, and the administrative headquarters of Merwara district. Since the ancient days, the region where Beawar lies is called Magra-Merwaran, and it was named after a local village called Beawar Khas by the British. This region was ruled by fierce tribes such as the kathat (chouhan Rajput, the descendents of prathviraj chouhan)and Rawat Rajputs (also offshoot of the same family as the Kathats but still following their ancestral religion Hindusim), British tried to subdue them but were unsuccessful because the tribes were scattered across many small villages and they were excellent in conducting guerrilla warfare. The Battle of Shyamgarh was fought between the Kathats and British. The British won and Kathats abandoned the fort of Shyamgarh,but employed guerilla tactics causing great loss to the British. So British founded a military cantonment with fortified walls for protection and further military missions. Another factor involved in building the cantonment here was Beawar's location at the strategic tri-junction of the royal states of Jaipur, Jodhpur, and Udaipur.  To keep the menace of Kathats and Rawat-Rajputs at bay, British raised a battalion, enrolling Kathats and Rawat-Rajputs (designating them as a Martial Race), and named it Magra-Merwara battalion. They used this battalion for further military missions which proved quite efficient. According to a legend, British posted a sign saying ""be aware"" as a warning to the British caravans and officers leaving the cantonment or crossing the cantonment. Slowly with time the local people came to think of it as the name of the cantonment and so the cantonment began to be called Beawar. It is a subdivisional headquarters. Situated in the midst of the vast sandy desert of Ajmer, Beawar takes you by surprise with its well laid out streets flanked by buzzing old mills and bustling street markets, all laid neatly within its walled territory."

Pillars found inside Belgaum fort have Kannada inscriptions in Nagari scripts, one from 1199 by Ratta King Kartaveerya IV. The city original name was Venugrama, a Sanskrit word which means ""village of bamboo"". Alternatively, it is referred to as Venupura in early Indian texts, which means ""city of bamboo"".[11]

Belgaum became a part of the Yadava dynasty kingdom (Sevunas) in early 13th century. An inscription from 1261 of King Krishna belonging to the Yadava dynasty attests to this. The region was invaded by Khalji dynasty of Delhi Sultanate in 14th century. Shortly thereafter, the Vijayanagara Empire was founded, and Belgaum came under the rule of Vijayanagara. In 1474, the Bahmani Sultanate conquered Belgaum with an army led by Mahamood Gawan.  Also known as Belgavi, nature has been generous with Belgaum.

After the occupation of Odisha by the British in June 1804, Bhadrak constituted one of the two administrative divisions of Cuttack and Balasore. In 1828, when Balasore was made a separate district, Bhadrak became one of its sub-divisions with an assistant magistrate and deputy collector as the sub-divisional head; but the munsif's court remained in Jajpur until 1901.

82,RAJASTHAN,Bharatpur ,"The formation of the state of Bharatpur was a result of revolts by the Jats living in the region around Delhi, Agra, and Mathura against the imperial Mughals.[2][verification needed] Gokula, a local Jat zamindar of Tilpat, led the first of such revolts in 1669. Even though the Jats were defeated and Gokula was executed, the movement was not completely crushed and discontent continued to simmer.[2] In 1685, there was a second uprising of the Jats under RajaRam of Sinsini, that was better organized this time and used guerrilla warfare, combining it with loot and plunder.[2] Now Aurangzeb approached the Kachhwaha ruler Bishan Singh to crush the uprising and appointed him as the faujdar of Mathura, granting him the entire area in zamindari. Conflict between Jats and Rajputs for zamindari rights also complicated the issue, with Jats primarily being landowners, whereas the Rajputs were primarily revenue collectors.[2] The Jats put up a stiff resistance but by 1691, RajaRam Sinsini and his successor Churaman were compelled to submit to the Imperial Mughals. However unrest among Jats continued and later on in the beginning of the 18th century, Churaman, taking advantage of the Mughal civil wars, was able to oust the Rajputs from the area and establish an independent state where Jat chiefs formed the ruling class.[2] Rajaram who also exhumed and burned the remains of Akbar is known for setting up a small fort at Sinsini. It was the key foundation of this kingdom. Bharatpur is most famous for the Bharatpur Bird Sanctuary, also known as the Keoladeo National Park.

100,KARNATAKA,Bijapur ,"The Bijapur district is historically, traditionally and legendarily, one of the richest districts in the state. The evidence found here reveals that it was an inhabited place since the Stone Age.

101,RAJASTHAN,Bikaner ,"Prior to the mid 15th century, the region that is now Bikaner was a barren wilderness called Jangladesh.[citation needed]

Rao Bika established the city of Bikaner in 1488. He was the first son of Maharaja Rao Jodha of the Rathore clan, the founder of Jodhpur and conquered the largely arid country in the north of Rajasthan. As the first son of Jodha he wanted to have his own kingdom, not inheriting Jodhpur from his father or the title of Maharaja. He therefore decided to build his own kingdom in what is now the state of Bikaner in the area of Jangladesh. Though it was in the Thar Desert, Bikaner was considered an oasis on the trade route between Central Asia and the Gujarat coast as it had adequate spring water. Bika's name was attached to the city he built and to the state of Bikaner (""the settlement of Bika"") that he established. Bika built a fort in 1478, which is now in ruins, and a hundred years later a new fort was built about 1.5 km from the city centre, known as the Junagarh Fort.  One of the earlier established cities, Bikaner still displays its ancient opulence through palaces and forts, built of red sandstone, that have withstood the passage of time. The city boasts of some of the world's best riding camels and is aptly nicknamed 'camel country' . Is Bikaner worth a visit? I would 100% recommend that you add Bikaner to your list, you won't be disappointed! Bikaner has so much to offer visitors in terms of forts, palaces, temples, food, sweets, shopping, and the mysteries of the desert too"

In the 13th century two of its governors, Shams-ud-din Iltutmish, the builder of the mosque referred above, and his son Rukn ud din Firuz, attained the imperial throne. In 1571 the town was burnt, and about a hundred years later, under Shah Jahan, the seat of the governorship was transferred to Sahaspur-Bilari. Budaun and its district was ceded to the British government in 1801 by the Nawab of Oudh.  Budaun is considered to be of immense religious significance among both Hindus and Muslims. At the first glance, with its dusty avenues and sleepy streets, it seems nothing more than a secluded small town. But there are numerous ruins and monuments that reveal many legends from its past. Casting a nostalgic charm, Budaun transports visitors to an era of mighty rulers and mystic Sufi saints like Nizamuddin Auliya - a Sufi saint. Adding to its allure is an aura of spirituality throughout the town.[17] Budaun is home to a number of ruins that can be traced back to the Mughal era.

109,RAJASTHAN,Bundi ,"

South-east Region of Rajasthan is known as Hadoti, - the land of the Hadas. Hada Rajputs are a major branch of the Chauhan Agnikula (fire dynasty) Rajputs. They had settled in the hilly terrain of Mewar, at Bambaoda, near Bijolian in the 12C. Bundi was conquered in 1241 by Rao Deva Singh from the Meena tribe. This was the first step in the establishment of Hadaoti, when the Hadas moved down from the ÂPatharÂ around Bambaoda.Bundi takes its name from the Bando Naal or the narrow passage, between the rugged hills. The town of Bundi is nestled in the cleft of the Araavali hills and has a special medieval flavor quite untouched by time. Prince Jait Singh of Bundi captured Kota in 1264 , and Kota became a part of Bundi as the Jaghir (land grant) of the eldest prince of Bundi. Kota became a separate state in 1624. 


The history of Bundi dates back to 1193 A.D when Prithviraj Chauhan lost out to Mohammed Gauri. Following that few Chauhan nobles fled to certain locations in the Chambal valley, where they overpowered the Meena and Bheel tribes. However, in the 12th century A.D Bundi came under the dominance of the Chauhans and reached its highest glory in medieval times. A little later the two camps in the Hada sect established independent states of Bundi and Kota on either side of the Chambal River. After independence, Bundi was incorporated in to the state of Rajasthan.
Bundi is Said to have derived its name from the tribal chifthainÂs name-Bunda Meena, hailing from the meena tribe that dominated the region. In the 12th century A.D Hada Rao Deva conquered this territory and founded Bundi state and Hodoti. Bundi is a small town in the Hadoti region of Rajasthan, which lies 250 km away from the capital city of Rajasthan and 39 km from Kota.

161,PUNJAB,Firozpur ,"Ferozepore is an ancient city situated close to the present day Indo-Pakistan border. It is believed to have been founded by Ferozeshah Tughluq in the 14th century. Another version claims that it was founded by a Bhatti chief called Feroze Khan. However, the first version is more widely accepted as Ferozeshah Tughluq had a passion for building new cities and renaming old ones especially after his own name.

FerozepurÂs strategic position in the northwest of the country has resulted in its being part of many military expenditions in the area. During the first Anglo-Sikh war in 1845, it due to the negligence of the British commander at Ferozepur that the Khalsa was able to cross the Sutlej unopposed. When Lord Hardinge declared war on the Sikhs, the first battle was fought at Mudki, 20 miles south-east of Ferozepur. In 1838, Ferozepur was the centre from where British troops advanced to Kabul during the rist Anglo-Afghan war.

Three heroic martyrs of IndiaÂs freedom struggle Shaheed Bhagat Singh and his associates Shaheed Rajguru and Shaheed Sukhdev have their final resting place on the banks of the river Sutlej in Ferozepur. On March 23, 1931, despite popular protest, these three heros were executed in Lahore and were stealthily cremated in the dead of night near Ferozepur.

Today, a Shaheed Bhagat Singh Memorial marks the spot and every year on March 23, thousands of people gather to pay homage of these noble heroes. Ferozepur has another historical memorial, the Saragarhi Gurudwara, commemorating the sacrifice of 21 Sikh soldiers who perished at Saragarhi in Baluchistan.

History

Hyderabad: tomb of Mu?ammad Qu?b Shah
Hyderabad: tomb of Mu?ammad Qu?b Shah
Hyderabad was founded by the Qu?b Sh?h? sultans of Golconda, under whom the kingdom of Golconda attained a position of importance second only to that of the Mughal Empire to the north. The old fortress town of Golconda had proved inadequate as the kingdomÂs capital, and so about 1591 Mu?ammad Qul? Qu?b Shah, the fifth of the Qu?b Shahs, built a new city called Hyderabad on the east bank of the Musi River, a short distance from old Golconda. The Charminar, a grand architectural composition in Indo-Saracenic style with open arches and four minarets, is regarded as the supreme achievement of the Qu?b Sh?h? period. It formed the centrepiece around which the city was planned. The Mecca Mosque, which was built later, can accommodate 10,000 people. The mosque was the site of a bombing attack in 2007 that killed several Muslims and injured many others. The incident aggravated Muslim-Hindu tensions in the city, which has experienced periodic outbreaks of violence over the years.

195,NCT OF DELHI,Hastsal ,"According to legend, this area was once submerged in water and elephants used to rest here. In Hindi, elephants are known as ""Hathi"" and place is known as ""Sthal""; hence, Hastsal - the resting place of elephants.[1]

In the 17th century Mughal Emperor Shahjahan had a hunting lodge in Hastsal. 1650, he built the Mini Qutub Minar close to his hunting lodge.[2] The Minar is a 55-foot (17 m) high minaret tower, locally popular as Hastsal ki Laat or the Hastsal Minaret. It is now situated at corner of Hastsal village and is popularly known as the Laat (Pillar). The minaret and hunting lodge, both still exist but lay abandoned and crumbling. The minaret closely resembles the Qutub Minar in design. Delhi is the city filled with most Mughal era architecture, some left tall, some are fade into the oblivion, some succumb to the wrath of time. Minar in  the Hastsal village is one such unfortunate monument which has faded into oblivion. It is forgotten to such an stage that even locals of the neighbourhood are not aware of its presence.

Referred as mini Qutub Minar, the monument is today covered by hundreds of houses, shrinking the area of Minar complex. The top two floors of the monuments have suffered badly the decay over the time but the Minar still stands tall. There was a trust to a lake around but with modern day construction all around the complex, the possibility of  existence of lake is bleak. HISTORY OF THE ATTRACTION If we believe in the oral past then Hastsal used to be submerged underwater and it was the place where the elephants used to come to bathe.

221,UTTAR PRADESH,Jaunpur ,"Jaunpur, city, southeastern Uttar Pradesh state, northern India. It straddles the Gomati River, about 35 miles (55 km) northwest of Varanasi (Benares).

Jaunpur probably was originally founded in the 11th century but was washed away by Gomati floods. It was rebuilt in 1359 by F?r?z Shah Tughluq, whose fort still stands. The city was the capital of the independent Muslim kingdom of the Sharq? dynasty (1394Â1479). It was conquered by the Mughal emperor Akbar in 1559 and fell under British rule in 1775. Jaunpur contains several old mosques, including the A?al? Mosque (1408) and the J?mi? Masjid (Great Mosque; 1478). A splendid bridge, built in the 16th century, spans the Gomati.

Jaunpur is an important road and rail junction. It is also an agricultural market with more than half of its own area devoted to gardening. Almost the entire alluvial plain around the city is under cultivation, much of it irrigated. Crops include rice, corn (maize), barley, and sugarcane. The area has long suffered greatly from floods and droughts. Perfume is the principal industrial product. The city houses numerous colleges of Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Gorakhpur University in Gorakhpur.  The picturesque and wonderful Jaunpur is a city and also significant municipal board in the Jaunpur district in Uttar Pradesh. Jaunpur district is located towards the northwestern side of another beautiful district called Varanasi. The great history of Jaunpur dates back to the year 1388, when Feroz Shah Tughlaq, the great Sultan of Delhi had appointed Malik Sarwar, a eunuch, as the governor of the region. Jaunpur district was added on into British India and was subject to the Zamindari system of land revenue collection. Modern Jaunpur now shares the underdevelopment of a major portion of Eastern Uttar Pradesh.

Jaunpur was an important centre of Islamic studies. Jaunpur is still proud of its architectural heritage that speaks volumes of its illustrious past. Today the city of Jaunpur is well known for its Jasmine oil, tobacco leaves, raddish and imarti, a sweetmeat.

There are a huge number of Tourist Attractions in Jaunpur. Every year thousands of visitors come from every corner of the world to visit this beautiful city of Jaunpur.

223,GUJARAT,Jetpur Navagadh ,"During the British period, the talukdars of Jetpur were Kathis of the Vala tribe. The talnka was a large and wealthy one consisting of 143 villages, and if under one chief would be a second class or even a first class state, as the revenue is not less than eight lakhs of rupees (Rs. 8,00,000).[1]

The Vala Kathis entered the province several centuries back, and one of their earliest seats was at Devlia Mota whence they conquered Chital. From Chital they acquired Jetpur and subsequently Mendarda and Bilkha. There are two different accounts given of the acquisition of Jetpur, viz. (1) that of the Tarikh-i-Sorath, which says that the first Nawab of Junagadh, Bahddur Khan I, granted Jetpur to Vala Vim; (2) tradition, which says that Vala Viro Najo of Chital aided the Valas of Bagasra in their feud with Vaijo Khasia of Mitiala, and that Vala Samat of Bagasra was slain in the battle. In consideration of Vira's aid the Valas of Bagasra gave him Jetpur. These Bagasra Valas acquired their share in Jetpur from the Khadia Baloch who received it from the local Muslim governors of former times.[1]

Jetpur is said originally to have been a holding of the former Valas, and to have been conquered from Vala Champraj by Shamskhan at the same time as the Vala town of Kileshvar in the Bardas was sacked. It is said that Vala Champraj had a beautiful daughter whom he refused to give to Shamskhan in marriage on which that noble sacked Kileshvar and took Jetpur, Vala Champraj and eighteen hundred Kathi horse being left dead on the field. But Vala Champraj is said to have killed his daughter, hence Shamskhan failed to obtain her. The great-grandfather of this Vala Champraj was Jetji who founded and named Jetpur (as said in the Tarikh-i-Sorath). Jetpur was held by sixteen talukdars descended from the common ancestor Vala Naja Desa in 1880s. Jetpur is one of the largest centers for screen-printing, block printing and yarn dyeing workshops in the country. It is famous for cotton saree industry and is major exporter of khanga and kitenge (fabrics used by native Africans for various use). "
224,UTTAR PRADESH,Jhansi ,"Jhansi city, situated between the rivers Pahunj and Betwa is a symbol of bravery, courage and self respect. It is said that in ancient times Jhansi was a part of the regions Chedi Rashtra, Jejak Bhukit, Jajhoti and Bundelkhand.

Jhansi was a stronghold of the Chandela kings. Balwant Nagar was the name of this place. But in 11th. century Jhansi lost its importance. In 17th. century under Raja Bir Singh Deo of Orchha Jhansi again rose to prominence. Raja Bir Singh Deo had good relations with the mughal emperor Jehangir. In 1613 Raja Bir Singh Deo constructed the Jhansi fort. He died in 1627. After his death his son Jujhar Singh succeeded him.

Maharaja Chattrasal Bundela of Panna was a good administrator and a brave warrior. In 1729 Mohammed Khan Bangash attacked Chattrasal. Peshwa Baji Rao (I ) helped Maharaja Chattrasal and defeated mughal army. As a mark of gratitude Maharaja Chattrasal offered a part of his state to Maratha Peshwa Baji Rao(I). Jhansi was also included in this part.

In 1742 Naroshanker was made the subedar of Jhansi. During his tenure of 15 years he not only extended the Jhansi fort which was of strategic importance but also constructed some other buildings. The extended part of the fort is called Shankergarh. In 1757 Naroshanker was called back by the Peshwa. After him Madhav Govind Kakirde and then Babulal Kanahai were made the subedars of Jhansi.

In 1766 Vishwas Rao Laxman was made the subedar of Jhansi. His period was from 1766 to 1769. After him Raghunath Rao (II) Newalkar was appointed the subedar of Jhansi. He was a very able administrator. He increased the revenue of the state. The MahaLakshmi Temple and the Raghunath Temple were built by him. For his own residence he constructed a beautiful building Rani Mahal in the city. In 1796 Raghunath Rao passed the subedari in favour of his brother ShivRao Hari.

225,HARYANA,Jind ,"In ancient period the area in which the Jind district lies formed an integral part of Kurukshetra in the traditional geographical account. It derived its name after Jainti, an ancient tirtha mentioned in the Mahabharata and the Padma Purana, founded in honor of Jainti, the goddess of victory. According to a local tradition, the goddess was invoked by the Pandavas for victory in the battle against the Kauravas.

The antiquity of the district is established on the basis of the discovery of the Pre-Harappan, the Late-Harappan and the Painted Grey Ware pottery at various places from the district and the mention of its tirthas in the Puranas corroborates it.

The district was first occupied by a pre-Harappan Chalcolitic agricultural community whose pottery has been recovered from a number of places such as Anta, Morkhi, Beri Khera (tahsil Safidon); Balu, Hatho, Rani Ran (Bata), Pahlwan, Dhakal (tahsil Narwana); Birbaraban, Barsana, Pauli, Karsola (tahsil Jind), etc. It is not yet possible to state from where these people had moved here or to throw much light on their socio-economic life. However, on the basis of the evidence of the nearby pre-Harappan sites like Mitathal (Bhiwani district), Siswal, Banwali and Rakhigarhi (Hisar district), it may be stated that these people possibly lived in mud brick and thatched roof houses, used wheel-made pottery, terracotta and copper-made objects.

Ritauli, Birbaraban, Pauli (Jind tahsil), and Balu (Narwana tahsil) have yielded pottery of the mature Harappan culture.

Further the existence of the classical Harappan site of Rakhigarhi(Hisar District) about 15 kms from Jind suggests the existence of such sites also in Jind district, but in the absence of excavations, it is not possible to go beyond this surmise. After the Harappans, the region was inhabited by the late-Harappans (1700 B.C.-1300 B.C.) whose pottery has been recovered from many places in the district. No Late-Harappans site has so far been excavated in the district , but on the basis of the evidence from the adjoining areas like Mitahal ( Bhiwani district ) , Bhagwanpur and Mirzpur (near Raja Karna Ka Kila, Kurukshetra District), etc. it appears that the pepole representing this culture lived in mud bricks houses , used oval ovens and thick sturdy red-ware, well levigated and burnt.The discovery of painted and incised terracotta figurines, possibly indicates their belief in animal worship. Jind is noted for its numerous temples sacred to the worship of Shiva. Raghbir Singh, ruler of Jind, built a temple known as Bhuteshvara temple, with a large tank around it, locally known as Rani Talab."

227,GUJARAT,Junagadh ,"As per the legend, the founder of the Ror Dynasty Raja Dhaj, Ror Kumar, alias Rai Dyach, ruled over the principality of Jhunagarh in the fifth century BC.[4] An early structure, Uparkot Fort, is located on a plateau in the middle of town. It was originally built in 319 BCE during the Mauryan dynasty by Chandragupta.[citation needed] The fort remained in use until the 6th century, when it was abandoned for about 300 years, then rediscovered by the Chudasama ruler Graharipu in 976 CE.[5] The fort was subsequently besieged 16 times over an 1000-year period. One unsuccessful siege lasted twelve years.

Within 2 kilometres (1.2 mi) of Uparkot Fort is an inscription with fourteen Edicts of Ashoka on a large boulder.[6] The inscriptions are in Brahmi script in a language similar to Pali and date from 250 BCE. On the same rock there is a later inscription in Sanskrit, which was added around 150 CE by Mahakshatrap Rudradaman I, the Saka (Scythian) ruler of Malwa, and a member of the Western Kshatrapas dynasty,[7] and which has been described as ""the earliest known Sanskrit inscription of any extent"".[8] Another inscription dates from about 450 CE and refers to Skandagupta, the last Gupta emperor. Old rock-cut Buddhist caves in this area, dating from well before 500 CE, have stone carvings and floral work. There are also the Khapra Kodia Caves north of the fort, and the Bava Pyara Caves south of the fort. The Bava Pyara caves contain artworks of both Buddhism and Jainism. Located in the Saurashtra region, Junagadh is famous for its fort, its markets, the song-dance culture, the spices and pickles, and for the friendly people.

230,ANDHRA PRADESH,Kakinada ,"During the colonization of the Dutch Coromandel coast, the Dutch East India Company maintained a trading post known as Jaggernaikpoeram or Jaggernaickpuram (among other spellings) to the English. On 25 September 1734 Haji Muhammad Hussain, then Nawab of Rajamundry, issued a parwana and a kaul to the Dutch by which the hamlet of "" Jagernaykpalam"" was given in full possession to the VOC for erecting a loge there.[11]

The British established the site in 1759 as a shipbuilding and ship repair facility. The British knew the area as the Coromandel coast, and Coringa Town (now called Kakinada) on the Coringa River, a branch of the Godavari river. As the principal seaport on this coast, it soon became a large shipbuilding yard of some importance. In 1802 a dock was built for repair of Royal Navy and other vessels, it boasted the only wet dock between Bombay and Calcutta. Cape Cori, or Hope Island as it was called was known internationally for shipbuilding and repairs.[12] The facilities were destroyed by massive cyclonic storms and tidal waves in 1787 (causing 20,000 fatalities) and again on 9 and 10 May 1832.[13][14] On 25 November 1839 yet another even greater cyclone finished off the port and it was not to recover. It has been estimated that the storm surge was as much as 40 feet. The harbour city was destroyed as were some 20,000 vessels of various sizes. This was one of the storms cited by Henry Piddington in a speech to the Â'Asiatic Society of Bengal'Â where he first used the term Â'cyclone'Â to describe the phenomena.[15] After the 1839 cyclone, homes were relocated further inland.

In 1901 due to sand depositing, and silting of the estuary not a single ship of any consequence could enter the port, by 1905 the construction of ships had ceased, and the port was closed.[16][17]

In the Madras Presidency, the District of Rajahmundry was created in 1823.[18] It was reorganised in 1859 and was bifurcated into Godavari and Krishna districts. During British rule, Rajahmundry was the headquarters of Godavari district, which was further bifurcated into East Godavari and West Godavari districts in 1925. When the Godavari district was divided, Kakinada became the headquarters of East Godavari and Eluru became headquarters of West Godavari. On 4 April 2022, East Godavari district further bifurcated into 3 and one of the New district was formed in the name of Kakinada, with Kakinada as headquarters.

232,WEST BENGAL,Kalyani ,"Kalyani, located in Nadia district in the state of West Bengal, is a relatively young town. During the Second World War, Kalyani, was the site of an American military airbase, formed out of 45 villages in the district of Nadia.[6]

The military garrison town was named after the then-sitting President of the United States Franklin D. Roosevelt as ""Roosevelt Town"" or ""Roosevelt Nagar"", with ""nagar"" meaning ""town"" in many Indo-Aryan languages, including Bengali. Hangars and other reminders of the airfield are still visible in the 'A' Block and some areas around Kalyani University, whose buildings were built on or over the runways.[6] After World War II, the United States Army Air Force left the base, and the airfield and hangars went into disuse.

The development of modern Kalyani is credited to the former Chief Minister of West Bengal, Bidhan Chandra Roy. After the independence of India in 1947, the master plan of the town was developed and the foundation stone for the town was laid by the then Governor of West Bengal, Kailashnath Katju, on 24 February 1951.[6] The town was built quickly in order to host the 59th Indian National Congress meeting in 1954. In memoriam of that conference, a road of the town was named as 'Congress Road'. In the same year, the name of the current Kalyani railway station, was changed from ""Chandmari Halt"" to ""Kalyani Central"". In 1957, the Kalyani police station was formed, and in 1979, the rail line was extended from Kalyani Central to Kalyani Simanta station, and also established direct connectivity to Kolkata through Kalyani Simanta local EMU trains.

During the British Raj it was a place for bungalows and gardens where the rich 'Babu' of Kolkata used to come.

With the partition of Bengal in 1947, ""millions of refugees poured in from erstwhile East Pakistan.""[4] In the initial stages bulk of the refugees were non-agriculturists. A few of them made their own arrangements, but ""it was squatters who made the East Bengali refugees famous or infamous."" Squatting (jabardakhal in Bengali) ranged from the forcible occupation of barracks to the collective take-over of private, government and waste land. By 1949, there were 65 refugee colonies in the Dum Dum and Panihati zone. The squatters were in a way ""self-settlers"" in the absence of adequate official arrangements for rehabilitation. Within a very short time the refugees (quite often with government/ administrative support) not only found a place to stay but developed a society with markets, schools, temples and sometimes even colleges, hospitals and recreational centres. Kamarhati is near a range of colorful Kolkata's more popular attractions. Two of the most popular attractions here are the fascinating Dakshineswar Kali Temple and the incredible Belur Math.In the event that time grants, make sure to likewise visit the Ratan Babu Ghat and Nicco Park."

243,UTTARAKHAND,Kashipur ,"Kashipur was known as Govishana, during the time of Harsha (606Â647 AD). The ruins of the large settlement of those days can be still seen near the city.[7] The famous Chinese pilgrim Xuanzang also travelled the city in the 7th century.[8]:?174? He described it as ""The Capital was 15 li in circuit. Its position was lofty, and of difficult access, and it was surrounded by groves, tanks and fishponds"".[9] Kashipur is believed to have a good historic trade of clothes and metal vessels.

The modern town of Kashipur was founded by Kashinath Adhikari, the governor of Tarai under King Devi Chand of Champawat. Later Raja Mohan Chand; one of the Kings of Kumaon's younger brother Lal Singh was given the estate Kashipur and Raja Guman Singh became its first King. Kashipur's last king Raja Hari Chand Raj Singh again got back the titular throne of Kumaon in British India as Raja Anand Singh (Raja of Almora) had no issue. The exact date of the foundation of the town is disputed, several historians having expressed their own views on the matter. Bishop Heber, in his book Travels in India wrote that Kashipur was founded by a deity named Kashi 5000 years back (approx 3176 BC).[8]:?175?[10] Sir Alexander Cunningham invalidated his views in his book, The Ancient Geography of India, in which he wrote ""the good bishop was grossly deceived by his informant, as it is well known that the town is a modern one, it having been built about AD 1718 by kashi-nath, a follower of Raja Devi-Chandra of Champawat in Kumaon"".[11]:?357Â358? Badri Datt Pandey in his book Kumaun Ka Itihaas, contradicting Cunningham's views, claimed the town to be founded in 1639.[12]:?41? Kashipur remained under the rule of Chand Kings until the latter half of eighteenth century until Nand Ram the governor of Kashipur became practically Independent and established his kingdom at Kashipur.

When the British arrived in Kumaun at the end of the 18th century AD, Kashipur was ruled by King Shib Lal, the second King of Kashipur. Kashipur was ceded to the British by Shib Lal in 1801 after which it became a revenue division. Bishop Heber visited here during his travel to Almora in November 1824.[13] Heber described Kashipur as a ""famous place of Hindu Pilgrimage"".[10] On 10 July 1837, Kashipur was included in the Moradabad district.[12]:?445? The revenue divisions of muradabad district were rearranged in 1944 following which Bajpur, Kashipur and Jaspur were rearranged into one pargana named as Kashipur.[14] Bajpur was brought under Tarai district in 1859 followed by Kashipur in October 1870.[14] Kashipur was later made the headquarters of Tarai district in the Ceded and Conquered Provinces.

Geography

The Dronasagar Lake during sunrise
At 29.22Â°N 78.95Â°E,[15] and 180 kilometres (110 mi) northwest of New Delhi,[16] Kashipur is located in the south-west of the Kumaon region of Uttarakhand in the Terai Â an area of relatively low-lying land, ranging between 500 and 1,000 feet (150 and 300 metres) above sea level and crossed by Kumaon's main north-south watershed between the basins of the Rivers Ramganga and Kosi. To the north of the city lies the Bhabar tract of Ramnagar, which separates the area from Shivalik Hills. Kashipur is drained only by minor rivers and lakes, primarily by Dhela river, a tributary of River Ramganga.[17][18] Several rivers and stream cross the region transversely and leave their deposit making the land fertile. However, these also dissect the region which renders it unfit for agriculture. Kosi is the master stream flowing in the western part with its broad course from north to south.

Geology
Geologically, Kashipur is dominated by the Terai tract, which runs horizontally through the city from Jaspur in the west, passing through the city center, to Bajpur and Rudrapur in the east. Terai formation consists of clays, sandy clays, fine to medium sand and occasional gravels.[19]:?14? In this formation there is a dominance of clayey successions over sandy horizons.[19]:?14? There are damp and marshy tracts in places. It is the zone of seepage where fine sand, silt and clay are deposited by the emerging streams. Almost level and fertile soil along with high water table has rendered the belt useful. According to the Bureau of Indian Standards, the town falls under seismic zone 4, in a scale of 2 to 5 (in order of increasing vulnerability to earthquakes).[20][21]:?27?

Climate

Katihar  is  a historical place and takes  place in Indian history. It is said that Hindu Lord Shri  Krishna came here and lost mani here in Manihari (a religious place of Katihar district). Katihar was a part of Purnia district and the latter was constituted in round about 1813 along with Malda district. Under the Mughal rule, the district was constituted of Sarkar Tajpur, east of the Mahananda and Sarkar  Purnia west of the river. The province of Bihar came under Muslim rule after Bakhtiyar Khilji conquered Bihar town then capital of Bihar towards  the  close of 12th century. His successor Ghiasuddin Iwaz extended the limits of the territory to include virtually the whole of Bihar, Katihar must also have come under Mohammedan rule in the beginning of the 13th century. The district passed into the hands of the British in  1770  when Mohammad  Ali  Khan was the Governor of Purnia. Ducarrel, the first English Supervisor of Collector of the district, replaced him. In 1872 the district was transferred from the control of Bihar and Banaras Board of Commissioners to the Calcutta Board of Revenue. The early years of  British  rule  were  largely directed to establishing law and order and setting up of the revenue administration on sound footing. Anga and Magadh Kings ruled over the Katihar during the time of Mahajanpada. Raja Birat of Morang also visited the place. With the advent of Muslim rule in the North India Ikhtiyar-ud-din Bakhtiyar Khilazi subjugated this area and subsequently this area remained under indirect Mughal rule. In the English rule, Katihar  came under the rule of Zamindars, Nawab who were Indian and was helping Englishman to rule over farmers, labour classes etc. Before the partition of Bengal, Katihar was belonging to Bengal.

Katihar was a sub-divisional town of Purnea district but on 2nd October 1973, Katihar acquired status of an independent district. It has a rich heritage and close linkage with the parent district of Purnia. The district derives its name after its  chief  town  of the same  name which probably got its name from a small village on the northeast called Dighi-Katihar where there is a big tank (dighi) excavated for the troops, when the soldiers of the Nawab of Purnea fought with the troops of Nawab of Murshidabad. Katihar district is one of the thirty-eight districts of Bihar state in India, and Katihar city is the administrative headquarters of this district. The district is a part of Purnia Division.

251,UTTAR PRADESH,Khora ,"KhÃ´ra (also chora; Ancient Greek: ????) was the territory of the Ancient Greek polis outside the city proper. The term has been used in philosophy by Plato to designate a receptacle (as a ""third kind"" [triton genos]; Timaeus 48e4), a space, a material substratum, or an interval. In Plato's account, khÃ´ra is described as a formless interval, alike to a non-being, in between which the ""Forms"" were received from the intelligible realm (where they were originally held) and were ""copied"", shaping into the transitory forms of the sensible realm; it ""gives space"" and has maternal overtones (a womb, matrix):

So likewise it is right that the substance which is to be fitted to receive frequently over its whole extent the copies of all things intelligible and eternal should itself, of its own nature, be void of all the forms. Wherefore, let us not speak of her that is the Mother and Receptacle of this generated world, which is perceptible by sight and all the senses, by the name of earth or air or fire or water, or any aggregates or constituents thereof: rather, if we describe her as a Kind invisible and unshaped, all-receptive, and in some most perplexing and most baffling partaking of the intelligible, we shall describe her truly.

Jacques Derrida has written a short text with the title KhÃ´ra,[2] using his deconstructionist approach to investigate Plato's word usage.

Maharaja Kalyan Singh of Kishangarh state (Reigned 1798Â1838)
Kishangarh was the capital of the princely state during the British Raj, which was located in the Rajputana Agency. It had an area of 2210 km2 (858 milesÂ²) and a population in 1901 of 90,970. This figure for population represented a decrease of 27% over the census figure of 1891, something presumably attributable to the famine of 1899Â1900. Population was 85,744 in 1931. The state enjoyed an estimated revenue of Â£.30,000/- in 1875 and paid no tribute to the British Raj.[3] In 1840, Prithvi Singh, became the 15th Maharaja of Kishangarh, and reigned till his death in 1879, after which he was succeeded by his son, Sardul Singh.[4]

Maharaja Madan Singh ascended the throne in 1900 at the age of sixteen,[5] at a time when the state was reeling from the impact of a devastating drought. The administration under him and his diwan was widely deemed worthy of approbation; irrigation from tanks and wells was extended and factories for ginning and pressing cotton were started.[5] A social reform movement for discouraging excessive expenditure on marriages made remarkable impact during his reign.[5] Popularly known as the Marble City of India for its bustling marble market, Kishangarh is located on the outskirts of Ajmer. The main attraction is the temple of nine planets, probably the only one in the world. While here, tourists can buy the popular Kishangarh-style miniature paintings that are characterised by the liberal use of green colour and portrayal of landscapes.

The urban agglomeration includes the localities of Trikkakara, Eloor, Kalamassery, and Trippunithura.

Kochi was an insignificant fishing village until, in the 14th century, the backwaters of the Arabian Sea and the streams descending from the Western Ghats to the east caused the separation of the village from the mainland, turning the landlocked harbour into one of the safest ports on IndiaÂs southwestern coast. The port assumed a new strategic importance and began to experience commercial prosperity.

When the Portuguese penetrated the Indian Ocean in the late 15th century and reached IndiaÂs southwestern coast, the Portuguese navigator Pedro Ãlvares Cabral founded the first European settlement on Indian soil at Kochi in 1500. Vasco da Gama, discoverer of the sea route to India (1498), established the first Portuguese factory (trading station) there in 1502, and the Portuguese viceroy Afonso de Albuquerque built the first European fort in India there in 1503. The city remained a Portuguese possession until it was conquered by the Dutch in 1663. Much Portuguese architecture still exists in the city. Spread over a series of islands and crisscrossed by the sea and backwaters, Kochi (long known as Cochin) speaks of the old world charm and leisure. The culturally and historically rich port city is the gateway for several visitors to start their tour of Kerala in south India. "

Zalim Singh, a diplomat, and statesman, emerged as another prominent figure of the state in the 18th century. Although initially being a general of Kota's army, he rose to the regent of the kingdom after the king died leaving a minor on the throne.[15] He remained a direct administrator of the state. In 1817, a treaty of friendship was signed between him and the British on his condition of carving out part from the existing state for his descendants resulting in Jhalawar coming into existence in 1838.[15] Kota was not involved in the earlier events of the Indian Rebellion of 1857. However, when in October 1857 rebels murdered the local British resident and his two sons, British forces responded by storming the city and, after some resistance, capturing it in March 1858.[17]

Kozhikode is the largest urban area in the state and 195th largest urban area in the world. During classical antiquity and the Middle Ages, Kozhikode was dubbed the ÂCity of SpicesÂ for its role as the major trading point of Eastern spices. It was the capital of an independent kingdom ruled by the Samoothiris(Zamorins) in the Middle Ages and later the capital of the erstwhile Malabar district under British rule. Arab merchants traded with the region as early as 7th century, and Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama dropped anchor at Kozhikode on 20 May 1498, thus opening a trade route between Europe and Malabar. A Portuguese factory and fort functioned in Kozhikode for a short period (1511Â1525, until the Fall of Calicut). The English landed in 1615 (constructing a trading post in 1665), followed by the French (1698) and the Dutch (1752). In 1765, Mysore captured Kozhikode as part of its occupation of the Malabar Coast.

While the city has been known in history under different names, Malayalam speaking communities have traditionally called it Kozhikode. Arab merchants called it Q?liq??. Tamils called it Kallikkottai while for the Chinese it was Kalifo. Although the cityÂs official name is Kozhikode, in English it is sometimes known by its anglicised version, Calicut. The word calico, a fine variety of hand-woven cotton cloth that was exported from the port of Kozhikode, is thought to have been derived from Calicut.

Kozhikode is a town with a long recorded history. From time immemorial, the city has attracted travellers with its prosperity. It has traded in spices like black pepper and cardamom with Jews, Arabs, Phoenicians, and Chinese for more than 500 years. As Kozhikode offered full freedom and security, the Arab and the Chinese merchants preferred it to all other ports. Kozhikode was the capital of Malabar during the time of Sri Samoothiri Maharajas, who ruled the region before the British took over. The cityÂs first recorded contact with Europe was when Vasco da Gama docked at Kappad (18 km north) in May 1498, among the leaders of a trade mission from Portugal. He was received by Sri Samoothiri Maharaja himself. Kozhikode and its suburbs formed part of the Polanad kingdom ruled by the Porlatiri. The Eradis of Nediyirippu in Eranad wanted an outlet to the sea, to initiate trade and commerce with the distant lands and after fighting with the king Polatthiri for 48 years conquered the area around Panniyankara. With the welcoming seashores, clean water and the numerous places to visit, Kozhikode, a city situated in North Kerala, is a perfect tourist destination, which is best known for its beaches and historical significance. From beaches and museums to temples, churches, wildlife, sculptures, parks and rivers, this city offers tourists everything they look for when they go on a holiday.

When the Indian Mutiny broke out in 1857, Sir Henry Lawrence, the British commissioner, and the European inhabitants of Lucknow were besieged for several months until rescued by British troops. The British then abandoned the city until the following year, when they regained control over India.

Lucknow is situated at the junction of numerous roads and rail lines, and Chaudhary Charan Singh International Airport is located about 6 miles (10 km) southwest of the central city. The city is a marketplace for agricultural products (mangoes, melons, and various grains are grown locally), and its industries include food processing, manufacturing, handicrafts, and railroad shops. Its population, which has grown dramatically since the late 20th century, surpassed that of Kanpur in the early 21st century to become the most-populous city in Uttar Pradesh. Lucknow, the capital of Uttar Pradesh, lies in the middle of the Heritage Arc. This bustling city, famed for its Nawabi era finesse and amazing food, is a unique mix of the ancient and the modern. It is home to extraordinary monuments depicting a fascinating blend of ancient, colonial and oriental architecture. Retaining a feast of British Raj architecture as well as home to two grandiose tombs, Lucknow was the administrative and cultural hub of the Nawabs of Avadh (Oudh). During the period of the weakening of the Mughal Empire, the city rose into prominence as a centre for poetry, music, dance and courtly diction. "
272,PUNJAB,Ludhiana ,"Ludhiana city was founded in the time of Lodhi dynasty which ruled in Delhi from 1451-1526 A.D. The legend goes that two Lodhi Chief Yusaf Khan and Nihand Khan were deputed by Sikandar Lodhi (1489-1517 A.D.) to restore order in this region. They camped at the site of present city of Ludhiana which was then a village called Mir Hota. Yusaf Khan went across the river Sutlej in Jalandhar Doab to check Khokhars who were plundering the Doab and made a settlement at Sultanpur while Nihand Khan stayed back and founded the present city at the site of village Mir Hota. The new town was originally known as Lodhi-ana, which means the town of LodhiÂs.

273,ANDHRA PRADESH,Machilipatnam ,"The town has existed since at least the 3rd century BCE (Satavahana period) when, according to Ptolemy, it was known as Maisolos. The Periplus of the Erythraean Sea calls it Masalia in the 1st-century BCE.[12] The port is on the southeastern, or Coromandel Coast, of India. At the mouth of the River Krishna on the Bay of Bengal, the Masula port saw flourishing sea trade.[citation needed]

Muslin was traded by ancient Greeks from the town and the word muslin originated from the name Maisolos.[13] Muslin was an important source of income for the town, being a favourite of Roman traders for domestic consumption. Several Roman coins were found during excavations of Buddhist towns near Machilipatnam.[14]

Masulipatnam rose to prominence under the Qutb Shahi kings. The town served as the primary sea port for their dominion, the kingdom of Golkonda. It was an outlet for textiles produced in the Godavari Delta. It was a major source of income for the kingdom, and contributed to its immense prosperity in the 1620s and 1630s.[15]

By the end of the 17th century, the port city had fallen into decline. This coincided with the Mughal conquest of Golkonda. However, mismanagement prior to the conquest may have also been a factor in the city's decline.[16]

The town was the district headquarters of the then, Masulipatnam district and now to the Krishna district, which was formed in 1859 in the composite Madras state. Machilipatnam is known for its Kalamkari textiles and paintings created using vegetable dyes. As a kalam (pen) is used in the technique of painting, it was called ""Kalamkari Painting"". During the 17th century, western traders were attracted by this art. "

276,TAMIL NADU,Madurai ,"It is narrated in legend that Madurai was originally a forest known as Kadambavanam. One day, a farmer named Dhananjaya who was passing through the forest, saw Indra (The king of the gods), worshipping a swayambhu (self created Lingam ) under kadamba tree. Dhananjaya, the farmer immediately reported this to King Kulasekara Pandya. Kulasekara Pandya cleared the forest and built a temple around the Lingam. A city was soon planned with the temple as its centre. On the day the city was to be named, Lord Shiva is said to have appeared and drops of nectar from his hair fell on the town. So, the place was named Madurai Â mathuram meaning ÂsweetnessÂ in Tamil.

Madurai has a rich historical background in the sense that Lord Shiva himself performed sixty-four wonders called ÂThiruvilaiyadalsÂ.

As early as the 3rd century BC, Megasthanes visited Madurai. Later many people from Rome and Greece visited Madurai and established trade with the Pandya kings. Madurai flourished till 10th century AD when it was captured by Cholas the arch rivals of the Pandyas.

The Cholas ruled Madurai from 920 AD till the beginning of the 13th century. In 1223 AD Pandyas regained their kingdom and once again become prosperous. Pandian Kings patronised Tamil language in a great way. During their period, many master-pieces were created. ÂSilapathikaramÂ, the great epic in Tamil was written based on the story of Kannagi who burnt Madurai as a result of the injustice caused to her husband Kovalan. In April 1311, Malik Kafur, the general of Alauddin Khilji who was then the ruler of Delhi, reached Madurai and raided and robbed the city for precious stones, jewels, and other rare treasures. This led to the subsequent raids by other Muslim Sultans. In 1323, the Pandya kingdom including Madurai became a province of the Delhi empire, under the Tughlaks.

The 1371, the Vijayanagar dynasty of Hampi captured Madurai and Madurai became part of the Vijayanagar empire. Kings of this dynasty were in habit of leaving the captured land to governors called Nayaks. This was done for the efficient management of their empire. The Nayaks paid fixed amount annually to the Vijayanagar empire. After the death of Krishna Deva Raya (King of Vijayanagar empire) in 1530 AD, the Nayaks became independent and ruled the territories under their control. Madurai is one of the most revered Hindu pilgrimage sites in India, known for its colourful Dravidian-style temples like Meenakshi Amman Temple, Azhagar Kovil, Koodal Azhagar Temple and Thirupparankundram."

279,UTTAR PRADESH,Mainpuri ,"Mainpuri anciently formed part of the great kingdom of Kanauj, and after the fall of that famous state it was divided into a number of petty principalities, of which Rapri and Bhongaon were the chief. In 1194 Rapri was made the seat of a Moslem governor. Mainpuri fell to the Moguls on BaberÂs invasion in 1526, and, although temporarily wrested from them by the short-lived Afghan dynasty of Shere Shah, was again occupied by them on the reinstatement of Humayun after the victory of Panipat. Like the rest of the lower Doab, Mainpuri passed, towards the end of the 18th century, into the power of the Mahrattas, and finally became a portion of the province of Oudh. When this part of the country was ceded to the British, in 1801, Mainpuri town became the headquarters of the extensive district of Etawah, which was in 1856 reduced by the formation of Etah and Mainpuri into separate collectorates. On the outbreak of the Mutiny in.1857 the regiment stationed at Mainpuri revolted and attacked the town, which was successfully defended by the few Europeans of the station for a week, until the arrival of the Jhansi mutineers made it necessary to abandon the district. Mainpuri is also known for Sarus Crane (Grus antigone). This elegant bird, called krouncha in India, is revered as a symbol of marital fidelity and is celebrated in myth and legend.

280,MAHARASHTRA,Malegaon ,"Malegaon was once a very minuscule junction named Maliwadi or the hamlet of gardeners. The history of Malegaon is as old as 1740 when a landlord named Naro Shankar Raje Bahadur, from the city started the construction of a fort that took almost twenty-five years to be completed. It was because of the construction work of the fort that thousands of Muslim artisans and workers flocked to Malegaon from different areas in India in search of a source of income.

The Britishers annexed the Malegaon fort in the year 1818 and this led to a large number of Muslims moving to Malegaon from Hyderabad. Again, thousands of Muslim weavers settle down in Malegaon from Varanasi struck by the famine that took place in the year 1862. It is only because of the Muslim population of the city that there are a large number of power looms and weaving industries found in Malegaon. The communal riots that became very common in India during the 1960s, have immensely contributed towards the swelling increase in Muslim migrants to the city of Malegaon.

281,PUNJAB,Malerkotla ,"The special relationship between Sikhs and Malerkotla goes back to the period when the tenth Sikh Guru, Sri Guru Gobind Singh ji, was engaged in a series of battles with the oppressive Mughal rules of the region and Sher Mohammed Khan was the Nawab of Maler Kotla . Sher Mohammad Khan a General in the Mughal Army, who actively participated in the military campaign against Sri Guru Gobind Singh ji, though having lost his brother and nephew in the battle of Chamkaur is said to have expressed his opposition to  bricking up alive of the  two young Sahibzadas of Sri Guru Gobind Singh ji, Zorawar Singh (aged nine years) and Fateh Singh (aged seven years), by the Subedar of Sirhind, Wazir Khan in 1705 and is said to have walked out, refusing to be a part of what he declared to be opposed to the tenets of Islam .

It is said that he uttered ÂhaaÂ or ÂhaiÂ in anguish of the punishment imposed on the two Sahibzadas. This became known as  ÂHaa da NaaraÂ.

On learning of this, Guru Gobind Singh blessed the Nawab and the people of Malerkotla with peace everlasting. This incident has been narrated over the years and gave Malerkotla a special place in the Sikh narrative. Gurudwara ÂHaa da NaraÂ was built to commemorate this act of Nawab Sher Mohammed Khan.

Malerkotla survived in alliance with the neighbouring Sikh state of Patiala ,though much reduced in area from its heydays and no doubt helped by the blessings of Sri Guru Gobind Singh ji.. Thereafter it continued under British protection till 1947 when it became the only Muslim majority Sikh state in East Punjab. After the dissolution of the princely states in 1948, Malerkotla became a part of P.E.P.S.U. or Patiala and East Punjab States Union . P.E.P.S.U. itself was dissolved in 1954 and Malerkotla became a part of Punjab.

Malerkotla is historically recognized for being a rare scene of communal harmony during the partition in 1947. In the darkest hour of partition, when the whole of East Punjab, including the princely states of Nabha, Jind and Patiala, was engulfed in a frenzy of communal violence, Malerkotla remained calm. In the popular imagination, Guru Gobind SinghÂs blessings ensured that the princely state remained virtually untouched by the communal violence that engulfed the neighbouring areas.

282,MADHYA PRADESH,Mandsaur ,"Epigraphical discoveries have brought to light two ancient royal houses, who call themselves as Aulikaras and ruled from Dashapura (present-day Mandsaur). The first dynasty, who ruled from Dashapura from the beginning comprised the following kings in the order of succession: Jayavarma, Simhavarma, Naravarma, Vishvavarma and Bandhuvarma. The Risthal stone slab inscription discovered in 1983 has brought to light another Aulikara dynasty, which comprised the following kings in the order of succession: Drumavardhana, Jayavardhana Ajitavardhana, Vibhishanavardhana, Rajyavardhana and Prakashadharma. After Parakshadharma, the ruler of Mandsaur was Yashodharma, who is identified with Vishnuvardhana, who erected a pillar of victory at Bayana due to which Bayana's name became Vijaygarh. In all probabilities, he was the son and immediate successor of Prakashadharma. Believed to be in existence since the time of Mahabharata, Mandsaur has connection with Ramayana as well. It is believed to be the home town of Mandodari, wife of Ravana.

Mandsaur is the result of the merger of two villages - Marh and Saur (or Dasaur). It has been ruled by a lot of prominent rulers of ancient as well as recent history.

A remarkable place to see in Mandsaur is the Pashupatinath Temple. On the bank of river Shivna, sits this grand Shiva temple which is famous for the 8 faced Pashupati Shiva Idol. The spiritual aura of the temple embraces the whole town. A small Hanuman temple and a shrine dedicated to Janaki Nath are also a part of the Pashupatinath Temple complex.

What also makes Mandsaur special is its treasure of archaeological sites. Situated in the outskirts of Mandsaur, the remains of Laduna Palace, Sitamau Place, Dashapura Fort, Sondhni pillars in the village of Sondhni, Dharamarajeshwar, Brahmanical rock cut temple, Buddhist caves, Yashodharman Pillar, and prehistoric painted rock shelters narrates the tales of glorious history.

A visit to Yashodharman Archeological Museum will be a bonus as it has curated magnificent sculptures from Hinglajgarh FortSome more places to see in and around Mandsaur are Mandsaur Fort, Gandhi Sagar Sanctuary, Telia Talab.

283,KARNATAKA,Mandya ,"Mandya district is part of large plateau from Mysore to the edges of Easter Ghats. Therefore, there are not many legends describing the origin of the district as such, but there are quite a few legends describing the origin of the place.

Mandya seems to have been known as ÂVedaranyaÂ and later, as ÂVishnupuraÂ in Kritayuga. It is said that a rishi (sage) was doing a penance here and installed an image of God Janardana and was said to be teaching wild beast to pronounce the sacred word, VEDA. On this account, the place came to be known as ÂVedaranyaÂ.

Several years later, but during the same yuga, another rishi, who was residing here, setup an image of the God Sakaleshwara swami and Lord Vishnu, it is said, appeared to him. The place was thereafter renamed as ÂVishnupuraÂ. Another account says that towards the age of Dwapara yuga, king by name Indravarma, who had not issues, came to this place in the hope of getting a son. His prayers were granted, and his son Somavarma built a fort and an agrahara at this place and gave it the name Mandevemu, which, it is believed has been corrupted into Mandya. It is also said that in ancient days, a great and popular sage, called Mandavya, lived in the area doing tapas and the place came to be called Mandya after his name.  KRS Dam and Brindavan Gardens is perhaps the biggest tourist attraction apart from Shivanasumudra Falls, Srirangapatna, Ranganatha Swamy Temple, Ranganathittu Bird Sanctuary among others. Maddur Vada is a famous delicacy from Mandya district which is best enjoyed with a hot cup of filter coffee."

285,UTTAR PRADESH,Mathura ,"The history of Mathura can be traced to approximately 2500 years. Situated on the banks of the Yamuna River, Mathura is a sacred town for the Hindus that has found mention in historical and mythological anecdotes. Mathura city is mentioned in the oldest epic, the Ramayana. It was first known as Madhuvan because of the thick and dense forests that were once there. Later it was renamed as Mathura. The history of Mathura is inextricably associated with Lord Krishna. Even in the accounts of the illustrious Alexandrian astronomer Ptolemy, we found a passing mention of a city called Modoura, which in Latin means the ""city of Gods"". Besides the Hindus, Mathura was also a revered site for the Jains and the Buddhists as well.

Any discourse on the historical background cannot achieve completion without the mention of the Kushana rule during which, Mathura evolved as a powerful principality to reckon with.

The greatest king of the Kushan Empire was Kanishka. Fa Hien, the celebrated Chinese ambassador, mentions the presence of a number of Buddhist monasteries in Mathura in around 400 AD. Mathura's positioning between the Muslim capitals of Delhi and Agra made it vulnerable to the Muslim attacks. The city was invaded by Mahmud of Ghazni in 1018-19. Aurangzeb too ravaged the city and demolished the temples. Once again in 1757, Mathura had to bear the brunt of Ahmad Shah Durani' s attack. The religious sites were targeted during these invasions and during the time when Heuien Tsang came visiting Mathura, the number of monks at the monasteries had plummeted to 2000 from that of 3000. These invasions were also instrumental in shaping Mathura's history.

There is an intermediate period of darkness in the history of Mathura when the city was relegated into oblivion. The resurgent Hindu movement of the Bhakti cult brought back the focus on Mathura. With a mission to revive the legend of Lord Krishna, the Hindu rulers, rich merchants and chieftains took the initiative to construct temples and riverfront ghats. Mathura at present, is a bustling town and a popular pilgrimage. Situated at a distance of about 140 kms from Delhi and 58 kms from Agra, Mathura witnesses a steady inflow of tourists.

The rich history of Mathura, the birthplace of Lord Krishna where he won over the evil king Kansa, symbolizes the victory of good over evil. Mathura is a holy city for Hinduism, the worldÂs third-largest religion. There are many places of historic and religious importance in Mathura and its neighbouring towns. The twin-city to Mathura is Vrindavan. As the home of Krishna in his youth, the small town is host to a multitude of temples belonging to various sects of Hinduism proclaiming Krishna in various forms and avatars.

286,UTTAR PRADESH,Maunath Bhanjan ,"From historical and archaeological point of views, Mau is one of the oldest places in the region. Ancient cultural and archaeological remains have been found at multiple places in the area giving enough evidence of long history of human habitat in the area. The known archaeological history of Mau is about 1500 years old, when the entire area was covered under thick dense forest. The nuts who used to live along Tamsa river, are considered to be the oldest inhabitants and the ruler of the area.[3]

As per the records on official webpage of the district, in 1028 A.D. King Syed Shalar Masood Ghazi came with a huge army to conquer the area but he went back to Afghanistan, leaving few of his people in the area. A Sufi saint Baba Malik Tahir and his brother Malik Qasim were part of the remaining group. There are places like Malik Tahir Pura and Qasim Pura in the name of these two saints in Mau city. The tomb of Malik Tahir is also present in Malik Tahir Pura and locally known as Mazaar Malik Tahir Baba.[3]

Around 1540-1545, Sher Shah Suri, the famous emperor who defeated Humayun, during his reign visited Kolhuvavan (Madhuban) to meet the great Sufi saint Syed Ahmad Wadva.[4] Mahvani, one of the daughters of Sher Shah had settled permanently near the dargah of Syed Wadva. The area also finds place in the historical book of Ziyaudeen Barni with a description that the great Mughal emperor Akbar passed through Mau on his way to Allahabad. Since time immortal, labourer and artisans who were the original inhabitants of this land has kept the fine saree art work alive and despite a gradual decline of the handloom industry in the eastern Uttar Pradesh, the saree industry of Mau still remains the last bastion of handicraft in the area otherwise an industrially thriving region till the end of last century. It is also believed that one of Shah Jahan's daughter, Jahanara Begum had also settled in that area where she built a mosque. The original structure of the mosque is not surviving anymore but place is known as Shahi Qatra and there is a Shahi Mosque in that locality reminding of its past glory. "

Coins issued by Samudragupta have been found in the near vicinity of the town.[3] The kingdom of Shashanka and Harshavardhana also included part of undivided Midnapore in their kingdom. However, the most significant archaeological site in the region is the bustling port of Tamralipta near present-day Tamluk, a site noted in the travelogues of Faxian and Xuanzang. Later Chaitanya passed through the area on his way from Puri to Varanasi as documented in the Chaitanya Charitamrita. After the fall of last independent Hindu dynasty of Kalinga-Utkala, Gajapati Mukunda Deva in the 16th century, this region came under one of the five Sarkars of Mughalbandi Odisha i.e. Jaleswar Sarkar which was ruled by the Subehdar of Odisha. The north boundary of Jalshwar was Tamluk and south was Soro and Dhalbhumgarh in the west to the Bay of Bengal in the east. Bahadur Khan was the ruler of Jaleshwar Sarkar or Hijli (including Midnapore) during the time of Shah Jehan. He was defeated by Shah Shuja, the second son of Shah Jehan, then the subahdar of Bengal.

During the era of the Muslim rulers of Bengal nawab, Alivardi Khan's general Mir Jafar fought successfully against Mir Habib's lieutenant Sayyid Nur near Midnapore town in 1746. This was part of his campaign to regain Odisha and thwart the Maratha attacks on Bengal. Mir Habib came up from Balasore and was joined by the Marathas, but Mir Jafar fled to Burdwan, leaving Mir Habib to retake Midnapore with ease. Alivardi defeated Janoji Bhosle, a Maratha chieftain, in a severely contested battle near Burdwan in 1747 and Janoji fled to Midnapore. The Marathas held on to Odisha including Midnapore until 1749 when it was reconquered by Alivardi. The Marathas continued to raid Midnapore, which proved disastrous for the residents.

In 1756, Alivardi died and his successor was Siraj-ud-daulah. On 20 June 1757, he was betrayed by Mir Jafar to the East India Company under the command of Lord Robert Clive at Plassey. This consolidated the company's hold on Bengal and Odisha (along with Midnapore). The district of Midnapore which included Dhalbhum or Ghatshila, now in Singhbhum, Jharkhand was annexed in 1760 along with Burdwan and Chittagong both handed over to the East India Company by Mir Qasim. The last free king of Dhalbhum was imprisoned in Midnapore town.

Some of the Malla kings of Mallabhum in the Bankura district held land in northern Midnapore district, while the Raj rules of Narajole, Jhargram, Lalgarh, Jamboni, and Chandrakona held sway in their local areas. The Raj rulers in Rajasthan would pay homage to Jagannath but carves out their own territories under the supremacy of the Hindu empires of Odisha.

Midnapore is notable for its contribution in the history of Indian freedom movement since it has produced many martyrs. During the British Raj, the city became a centre of revolutionary activities, such as the Santal Revolt (1766Â1767) and the Chuar rebellion (1799). The Zilla School, now known as Midnapore Collegiate School was the birthplace of many extremist activities. Teachers like Hemchandra Kanungo inspired and guided the pupils to participate in the Indian Freedom Movement. Three British District Magistrates were assassinated in succession by the revolutionaries Bimal Dasgupta, Jyothi Jibon Ghosh, Pradyot Kumar Bhattacharya, Prabhakangsu Pal, Mrigan Dutta, Anath Bandhu Panja, Ramkrishna Roy, Braja Kishor Chakraborty, Nirmal Jibon Ghosh. Khudiram Bose and Satyendranath Basu were some of the young men that laid down their lives for the freedom of India. Kazi Nazrul Islam attended political meetings in Midnapore in the 1920s. Raja Narendra Lal Khan, ruler of Narajole, who donated his palace for Midnapore's first college for women, had been implicated, (although it turned out to be false) for planting a bomb.

Khudiram Bose was born in the Habibpur in 1889 and studied at Midnapore Collegiate School up to the eight standard. He was first caught by a policeman for distributing seditious leaflets in Midnapore in 1906. He was an anarchist and protested against the moderate policies of Surendranath Banerjea. Khudiram was sentenced to death for a failed attempt to kill Magistrate Kingsford. Satyendranath was executed on 21 November 1908. Noted freedom fighter and Bengal Province Congress Committee President Birendranath Sasmal practised at the Midnapore High Court.  Midnapore is notable for its contribution in the history of Indian freedom movement since it has produced many martyrs. During the British Raj, the city became a centre of revolutionary activities, such as the Santal Revolt (1766Â1767) and the Chuar rebellion (1799)."
288,UTTAR PRADESH,Meerut ,"Meerut is situated between the holy rivers Ganga and Yamuna Meerut is a busy trade centre of western Uttar Pradesh. Thanks to its geographical importance, the fertile Ganga-Yamuna doab had been an important centre of human activities since the very early times of Vedic Civilisation.

Meerut probably derives its name from the word ÂMaya RashtraÂ, meaning the country of Maya, who was the architect of the asuras (the demons) as per the Hindu mythology. His daughter Mandodari was the wife of Ravana, the antagonist of the first epic, Ramayana. In Mahabharata, the Kauravas had their capital in Hastinapur, which is situated in present day Meerut District.

From the medieval period onwards, the proximity of this city to Indraprastha (present day Delhi) helped it play an important role in the affairs of India. However, Meerut attracted the attention of the historians for the first time when the brave people of this city offered fierce resistance to the invading forces of Qutub-ud-din Aibak (11th century AD) and Timur (14th century AD). Since then, it remained under the suzerainty of those who ruled over Delhi.

With the capture of power by the British, Meerut became a major military centre. The aggrieved Indian soldiers of the British Army began their fight against the imperial powers in this soil on 10th May, 1857. They captured the control of the city in one day and marched to Red Fort in Delhi, which was considered to be the symbol of control over the whole of India. On their way, they were joined by the common people who shouted patriotic war cries. By the next morning, Red Fort had fallen into the hand of the freedom fighters.

The spark that began in Meerut soon spread all over India and acquired the form of a nationalistic struggle for independence. It took one year for the British to put down the freedom struggle. Nevertheless, the First War of Indian Independence that began in Meerut continued to inspire the patriots all over the country. It paved the way for the organised national movement in later 19th century. The grateful country celebrated the 150th anniversary the First War of Independence in a suitable manner in 2007.

Meerut is called the Âsports city of IndiaÂ because of the thriving sports goods industry here. Sugar and electronics goods are other flourishing industries. Meerut and nearby Modinagar form an educational hub adjacent to the national capital.  The city is one of the largest producers of sports goods, and the largest producer of musical instruments in India. The city is also an education hub in western Uttar Pradesh. Meerut is also known as the ÂSports City Of IndiaÂ. A developing city in the state of Uttar Pradesh, Meerut is an ancient city with civilization that dates back to the Indus Valley. It is approximately 65 Km from the capital city of Delhi. Meerut is a city with immense historical significance as it played a vital role in the 1857 revolt."

293,MADHYA PRADESH,Morena ,"The district is located on the north-western border of the state in Chambal valley. The present Morena is combined with the Sikarwari and Tanwargarh districts of 19th century. Due to major settlement of SikarwarRajputs in Ambah area, this was known as Sikarwari. Similary due to the settlement of Tanwars(Tomars) in Joura area, the central part of the district was called Tanwargarh. The district Sikarwari, the part of former Gwalior state was later on merged into Tanwarghar in 1904 with headquarters of Joura-Alapur which is presently a tahsil headquaters. As per order No 6/10/1923 the pargana headquarters shifted from Nurabad to Morena and vide order No. 492 dated 6/10/1923 the district headquarters was also changed to Morena.

Morena, Porsa, Ambah, Joura, Kailaras and Sabalgarh tahsil remained in Morena district.

During an excavation in the year 1927-28 in Kutwar village, a huge treasure chest of 18,659 bronze coins was found from which it can be firmly said that during the 3rd and 4th centuries this area was under the rule of Naga Kings.

After the eventful battle of Panipat in 1761, Mahadji Sindhia captured Gwalior and by footing into nearby regions and the history of Morena became a part of Gwalior. Due to the services and the policy acceleration by the French commander of the Sindhias army named Jean Baptiste Fillose who trained and administered the army of Sindhia the army power of Mahadji Sindhia became more powerful. After Mahadji Sindhia, Daulat Rao Sindhia established Gwalior as Capital in 1810. In 1853 the Gwalior state was divided into different units under the able guaidance of minister Sir Dinkar Rao during the regime of Jayaji Rao Sindhiya (1843-1886).

294,GUJARAT,Morvi ,"Morvi was founded as a princely state around 1698 by Kanyoji when the heir apparent of Cutch State fled Bhuj with his mother after his father Ravaji was murdered and the throne was seized by his uncle Pragmalji I.[4] It became a British protectorate in 1807. The state was in the colonial sway of the Kathiawar Agency of the Bombay Presidency.

In 1943, with the implementation of the 'attachment scheme', Morvi State enlarged its territory by an additional 310 km2 with about 12,500 inhabitants when the Hadala Taluk and the Kotda-Nayani Thana, as well as the small Malia princely state were merged.

On 15 August 1947, the state officially ceased to exist by merging into the west Indian United State of Saurashtra (initially - of Kathiawar), which later merged into Bombay state; since that was divided, it is in Gujarat. Morbi is renowned for its ceramic industry. Around 70% of India's ceramics are produced here."
295,BIHAR,Motihari ,"From epic time till today, the history of Champaran has been glorious and important. It is mentioned in the Purana that the devotee Dhruv, son of King Uttanapada, here had done terrible penance for attaining knowledge at the place called Tapovan. On the one hand, the land of Champaran is sacred due to the Goddess of Sita, on the other hand, the Satyagraha of Gandhiji in modern India is an invaluable page in the history of Indian independence. At the time of King Janak, this was part of the Tirahut kingdom. People believe that Jankigharh, also known as Chanchigarh, was the capital of King Janaks Veeveda state. Which later became part of the Vaishali empire in the 6th century BC. Lord Buddha had given his sermons here, in memory of which in the 3rd century BC, Priyadarshi Ashok made pillars and constructed stupas. After the decline of the Gupta Dynasty and the Pala Dynasty, the entire Champaran region, including Mithila, became subject to the Karnat dynasty. Local satraps were directly ruled by Muslims until and after this. Mahatma Gandhi came to Motihari in April 1917 on the call of Prince Shukla, a rayat of freedom and freedom fighter of India during the freedom struggle, and successfully used the first successful experiment of Satyagraha in protest of the three acrimonious cultivation of the Nil crop. This was the beginning of the new phase in the fight for independence. Later, Bapu came here many times. The British had made Champaran an independent unit in 1866, but in 1971 it was divided into Eastern and Western Champaran.  The town of Motihari is located in the state of Bihar and is a very popular tourist destination among both pilgrims as well as backpack travellers. The town of Motihari is located at a distance of 156 km from the capital city of Patna. Motihari tourism is predominantly known for its historical worth. Motihari is the city from where Mahatma Gandhi began his legendary Satyagraha for the first time against the British rule. The immense historical worth makes Motihari tourism stand out as a compelling tourist destination. The Mahatma is also credited for helping the town of Motihari reap the fruits of education, as he helped the locals establish a school in the vicinity. The town of Motihari is a magnet for many Buddhist tourists throughout the year, as a major Buddhist stupa is situated here. This stupa is widely known as Motihari stupa and is undeniably a magnificent structure, that stands tall at a height of 104 ft. Many believe that the existing stupa is the remains of a much greater stupa. A compelling fact of Motihari tourism is that the legendary author George Orwell was born here and one can visit George Orwells monument. The Mahatma Gandhi Museum and Stone Pillar are the most distinguished tourist locations of Motihari Tourism. Motihari embraces many small-scale industries such as a paper factory, a sugar mill and similar industries. Motiharis sugar mill is one of the largest in Bihar. With the right mix of educational institutions, mills and factories, and historical sites like Gandhi Sangrahalaya, Jheel, Gandhi Maidan, natural landscape of the adjoining countryside flanking the foothills of the Himalayas, Motihari proves to be an attractive place for people to spend quality time. The Motihari agriculture is widely known for its production of litchi fruit and sweet potatoes. The climate of Motihari is quite hot during summers and chilly during winters. One should visit Motihari post monsoon time as it is best suited for the purpose of travel.

297,PUNJAB,Muktsar ,"Sri Muktsar Sahib (/?ri? ?m?kts?r sa?h?b/) (often referred to as Muktsar (/?m?kts?r/)) is a historical city and district headquarters in Punjab, India. The 2011 Census of India put the total population of Sri Muktsar Sahib municipality to 117,085,[1] making it the 14th largest city of Punjab, in terms of population. Historically known as Khidrana or Khidrane di dhab, the city was made the district headquarters in 1995. Chronological evidence indicates that the city was named Muktsar after the battle of Muktsar in 1705. Also Guru Angad Dev ji was born in Matte di Sarai (Sarainaga) in same district of Sri Muktsar Sahib. The government officially changed the name of the city to Sri Muktsar Sahib in 2012,[2] though the city is still primarily referred to by its unofficial name  Muktsar. Mai Bhago park, located just behind Guru Gobind Singh Park, is a war memorial as a reminiscence for the battle of Sri Muktsar Sahib in the memory of Mai Bhago and 40 Muktas. However, the park is ill-maintained. The city has another small park in the Mukt-e-minar complex, which houses the world's tallest khanda."
298,BIHAR,Munger ,"The territory included within the district of Munger (famously Monghyr) formed pent of the Madhya-desa as Midland of the first Aryan settlers. It has been identified with Mod-Giri a place mentioned in the Mahabharata, which was the capital of a kingdom in Eastern India near Vanga and Tamralipta. In the Digvijaya Parva of Mahabharata, we find the mention of Moda-Giri, Which seems similar to Moda-Giri. Digvijaya Parva suggests that it was a monarchical state during early times. A passage in the Sabha-Parva describes Bhimas conquest in Eastern India and says that after defeating Karna, king of Anga, he fought battle at Modagiri and killed its chief. It was also known as Maudal after Maudgalya, a disciple of Buddha, who converted a rich merchant of this place into Buddhism. Buchanan says that it was the hermitage of Mudgala Muni and this tradition of Mudgal Risi still persists. Munger is called Modagiri in the Monghyr copperplate of Devapala. The derivation of the name Munger (Monghyr) has found the subject of much speculation. Tradition arcribes the foundation of the town to Chandragupta, after whom it was called Guptagars a name which has been found inscribed on a rock at Kastaharni Ghat at the north-western corner of the present fort. It is insisted that Mudgalrisi lived there. Tradition ascribes the composition of various suktar  of the 10th Mavdala of the Rigveda to Rishi Mudgal and his clan. However, General Cunnigham had strong suspicicion when he connects this original name with Mons as Mundas, who occupied this part before the advent of the Aryans. Again Mr. C.E.A. oldham, ICS, a farmer collector suggests the possibility of Munigiha,  ie , the abode of the Muni, without any specification which later corrupted to Mungir and later became Munger.

At the dawn of history, the present site of the town was apparently comprised within the Kingdom of Anga, with the capital Champa near Bhagalpur. According to Pargiter, Anga comprises the modern districts of Bhagalpur and Munger commissionary. The Anga dominion at one time included Magadha and the Shanti-Parva refers to an Anga king who sacrificed at Mount Vishnupada. In the epic period Modagiri finds mention as a separate state. The success of the Anga did not last long and about the middle of the sixth century B.C. Bimlisara of Magadha is said to have killed Brahmadatta, the last independent ruler of ancient Anga. Hence the Anga became an integral part of the growing empire of Magadh. As epigraphic evidence of the Gupta period suggests that Munger was under the Guptas. To the reign of Buddhagupta (447-495 A.D) belongs a copper plate of A.D. 488-9 originally found at Mandapura in the district.  Munger is known for Sita Manpatthar (Sita charan) Sitacharan temple situated on a boulder in the middle of the Ganges in Munger (Mithilanchal) is the main center of public faith regarding Chhath festival."
